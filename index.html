  <h1>NYAKUNDI EMMANUEL</h1>

  <p>
    Systems programming, observability, performance, concurrency primitives,
    and correctness under contention.
  </p>

  <p>
    I like building small things that force me to confront kernel behavior,
    scheduling, memory, and failure modes directly — without frameworks
    smoothing over the sharp edges.

        Bounded Work Queue using Mutex + Condition Variables

      <br>
      <small>
        A from-scratch implementation to reason about backpressure,
        spurious wakeups, invariants, and shutdown semantics under contention.

        An experiment-driven write-up on syscall latency, cache warmup,
        and why naïve benchmarks lie.

      <small>
        A deep dive into PID 1 semantics, signal delivery, orphan reaping,
        and the parts of “containers” that are really just kernel contracts.

        mutex_condvar
      </a>
      <br>
      <small>
        A bounded work queue implemented in C using pthread mutexes and
        condition variables. Built to study invariants, shutdown behavior,
        and correctness under high contention — not performance tricks.

      <br>
      <small>
        Small programs to measure syscall latency and page cache behavior.
        Focused on methodology, repeatability, and understanding what the
        kernel is actually doing.

        procjail

      <br>
      <small>
        A minimal process jail written in Go. Implements PID namespaces,
        PID 1 responsibilities, signal forwarding, process groups,
        graceful shutdown, and reaping — deliberately without container tooling.
